FIXME 0.f explain that the total number of credits in the Ooniverse is always the same through a Raxxla adventure
FIXME 0.f make the tax level evolve ?
FIXME 0.f How do we know the real productivity? Is there an OMC? Black work wouldn't be reported, nor taxed. Yet another time Raxxla?
FIXME 0.f productivity could slowly converge towards a value depending on space scarcity
FIXME 0.f use Fuel tweaks oxp depending on state of war, recently attacked system, and player home system :p
FIXME 0.f tweakability / configurability / by player / by other oxps
FIXME 0.f prices vary depending on war
FIXME 0.f identifying player as citizen from some system (Citizenship), consequences
FIXME 0.f player taxation
FIXME 0.f the strategic map should be available through an equipment, or a role (commander ;) )
FIXME 0.f provide Diplomacy lore (the deep comments in the code) to the player through other oxps. Snoopers army? Spacebars? The oxp from which you're the hero?

FIXME 0.n manage versioning of savefiles (last step before 1.0)

FIXME 0.perfectperf use tco to avoid recursion: http://www.integralist.co.uk/posts/js-recursion.html
FIXME 0.perfectperf minify, https://jscompress.com/, https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2
FIXME 0.perfectperf benchmark with lazy regexps

FIXME 0.z make a story/scenario generator?

FIXME 0.z passengers are taxed too; maybe player may pay less depending on passenger home system? why would passenger allow that?
FIXME 0.z some systems could have their citizens not taxed? free passage? by some chosen systems? vassal systems?
FIXME 0.z "Troll wars" (noble Troll specie against human cultural trolls)
FIXME 0.z "Trumble wars" (trumbles are used as weapons to disrupt blockades)
FIXME 0.z "Day of the Tentacle"
FIXME 0.z the events history could be visualized through Snoopers
FIXME 0.z the events history could be visualized through a map

FIXME 0.z: implement scoring of relations between systems
goodwill low depending on history:
if they have attacked that turn,
polarization? if the system has several neighbours, it dislikes better one of them
if they have attacked that turn a member of the alliance,
if they prepare for attack (even an enemy?),
if they're from an opposite economy,
if they're from a different alliance (enemy alliance?)
if they currently got a bad economy?
if the other currently has a bad economy?
if they're from a disliked race
polarization? if the system has several neighbours, it dislikes better one of them
if they harbor an enemy faction
polarization: if they have enough money to attack and the other not enough to defend
goodwill high:
if they have helped in the past,
if they are member of the alliance,
if they prepare for defense,
if they're from a comparable economy
if they're next to a common enemy
if they're on a commercial road?
if they're from a liked race
polarization? if the system has several neighbours, it likes better one of them
if they harbor an ally faction
polarization: if they have enough money to defend and the other not enough to attack
What's an enemy?
initial scoring + eventsScoring losing 10% each turn (year?) + current turn eventStoring
initialScore = economy comparison + ideology comparison + commercial road
who should we score? a system scores those systems it is observing?
staticScore[observerId][observedId] = {
    economyComparison:,
    ideologyComparison:,
    sameCommercialRoad:,
}
dynamicScore[observerId][observedId] = {
    nextToCommonEnemy:,
    preparingForDefense:,
    harboursEnemyFaction:,
}
ally to alliance if avg(systemsScores) > threshold
attack if systemMoney > targetProductivity * targetPopulation, divided by constant

WAR

prepare_fight if:
- treasury > fightPreparationThreshold => war_treasury
Is this really needed?
Fight may be prepared at all times

- attacked => lowers drastically score
- ally attacked => lowers (less) drastically score

attack or finance_ally if:
- score < attackThreshold ?

- war_declared
- roi > roi_threshold && war_treasury > attack_budget (depending on attacker culture? [0,30% of war_treasury?])

An attack may remove from the attacked:
 pib -= [5%,,5%]*pib
 treasury -= attack_budget * 100 * [100%,1%]
 war_treasury -= attack_budget * 10 * [100%,1%]
An attack may from the attacker:
 war_treasury += attack_budget * [-100%,100%]

 depending on the success [100%,0%]

 success repartition must be a gauss curve

 what of ROI? hmm, economy size might change depending on battles?
 So an increase in economy size is a one-year increase to be compared to the cost of the attack
 what about using a zero-sum game principle? like economy size decrease goes to neigbors?
 or declaring war weakens some economic relations between systems and strengthens others?

 or wars are decided by hidden interests, not by global economy? per good type? per 2 types only agro and industrial?
 I like the idea that the exchange depends on prices differences * size of economy
 but should the exchange be imbalanced? how is that impacting the economy growth?
 what are the coefficient on each good? what of forbidden goods?

 the number of tons entering a system is equal to the number of tons exiting. Nope. the max number only, but it's theoretical.
 the max number 128 is administrative? why is it everywhere, then?
 not to be considered, as it would imply a very small spatial exchange between systems, very inferior to systems economy size

 We need spatial ascensors, so as to have a low cost from planet to station,
  which is needed not to have prohibitively expensive food and other things.
 Or cheap anti-gravity =o
 => big exchanges between systems

 Let's say that we think in terms of %age of total GDP, and not in GDP
 Let's say that the evolution of total GDP due to productivity increase is small in Ooniverse, compared to the variation due to the wars.
 In that case, we can think we are in a zero-sum game, in terms of %age of total GDP.
 Each loss of GDP %age is gained by the others.
 We can (it is a game shortcut) reattribute the lost gdp to some others
   => normal way is to add depending on their own current gdp, in the galaxy.
   => another way is to consider it goes to near systems (neighors?).
   => another way is to consider it goes to systems depending on their distance (squared)
    => this way is nice but expensive to calculate
       (needs the distance between each systems, and the sum of these distances)
   => another way is to consider that neighbors in fact taxes the money,
      and that systems other than neighbors earn a negligible increase
   => money goes to neighbors, coefficiented on inverse distance squared

   => attack ROI depends on the attacked distance
   => financed attack ROI depends on the attacked distance
   => finance ROI should always be better than attack ROI?
       then finance is preferable to attack when it is possible
       => how to ensure that 2 allies in war with a third system won't only finance each other instead of attacking?

   there must be an incentive to finish the other
   => spoils of war: combat_budget+, war_treasury+, treasury+, total gdp appropriation this turn (no neighbours),
    greater portion of gdp (40% of attacked gdp * coeff depending on attacker gdp
     (representing the ability to process the attacked gdp)), attacked forced peace

   What if 2 allies finish a system at the same time? It isn't possible to have a "at the same time" event.
    Well maybe, events concurrency.

    FIXME 0.f use station in fire when a system has been beaten http://aegidian.org/bb/viewtopic.php?t=3460&start=154

FIXME 0.f PEACE

FIXME 0.z have an indicator "Ongoing war" per system

FIXME 0.z have a notion of galaxy, station, traveller as actors
FIXME 0.z tax evasion
FIXME 0.z factions?

 maybe the right way is to generate LOTS of news and let the player register to those they want?
 Snoopers, citizenship news company

FIXME 0.z each turn, a system has an event card: a sun explodes, or a native singer becomes famous, which changes taxes, or alliances, or fights, or... Use some mega bomb for a supernova style event
FIXME 0.z what about the story of a war writing itself?
FIXME 0.z war cargoes
FIXME 0.z player's greed is the key

FIXME 0.z what happens if the player lands on an enemy planet?

FIXME 0.f make Snoopers optional?

=========================
Space is big. But the space we are interested in is the space around planetary systems :)
What about ships localization detection and declaration?

On our old earth, we have transponders onto every (naval) ship and plane. We even have control towers.
We have radars too, and the chinese have recently made a quantum radar (so no evasion through deflecting the wave like the B-2 stealth bomber do).

We could have mandatory transponders in corporate systems, optional transponders in, say, feudal systems, useless transponders in anarchy systems.
That way, ships are declared, and space content is better known.

We could have (gravitic?) radars which results are shared ad-hoc (like wifi) by law-abiding pilots ^^
That way, ships are detected, and space content is better known.

Using these, from the point of view of the ship commander, space isn't empty or big anymore; it's crowded and interaction are possibly frequent.
